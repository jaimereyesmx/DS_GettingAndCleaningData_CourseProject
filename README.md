# Getting And Cleaning Data course project
The code in this repo was created as part of the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data coursera course. 

run_analysis.R performs the following steps:
1. Reand and merge the training and test datasets to create one dataset.
2. Extract only measurements on the mean and standard deviation of each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
